I used to be so broken, lost, empty
A heart with no beat
A singer with no song to sing
So I know the feeling
The silence is deafening
But in your pain lies a blessing
A sweeter song of victory
So keep walking, walking, walking
Though it seems so far
No matter who you are
See, there's one thing that I know
Life it can leave
You so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better, better, better

It's alright, dry your eyes
Send a prayer to the sky
I know its hard to fight
But you must believe
That it gets better

Listen to me, I know you're scared
Your heart's bleeding
But what are you gonna do now?
I think is time you break free!

And keep walking, walking, walking
Though it seems so far
No it doesn't really matter who you are
See, there's one thing that I know ohhhhh!
Life it can leave, you so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better, better
Is alright, dry your eyes, send a prayer
To the sky. I know its hard to fight
But you must believe
That it gets better, better

Almost out of here
See, I was almost took
I wanted to die
From how I was doing wrong
I cried out every night
Looking for a helping hand
That's when it happened
Jesus took me in

He held me close
Gave me love
Refilled my heart
Helped me grow better
Because his love, it made me whole
He's available anytime
Try Him out
He'll change your life
See, cause I know Yeah

Life, it can leave
You so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
You must believe
That it gets better, better, better yeah
Life it can leave you so bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
But you must believe
That it gets better, better ohhhh!
